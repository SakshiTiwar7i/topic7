    <h3>Activity 1</h3>
    <h4>What state for each light is needed?   </h4>
    <div class="white">
    <p style="color:black">The state of the light lies between 0 and 1, that is, it can be greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 1.
        Hence indicating, the light can be dimmed, switched on, switched off.
        (USE OF PWM and Duty Cycles)
        </p>
    </div>
    <h4>What information do you need?    </h4>
    <p>•DateTime input</p>
    <p>•Environment luminosity readings</p>
     <p>•User voice input</p>
     <p>•Device input</p>
      <p>•Switches state</p>
      <p>•Motion sensing input</p>
      <h4>What other devices are needed?  </h4>
      <p>•Smartphones, fitness bands/smart watches    </p>
      <p>•Smart switches (Manual Control)</p>
      <p>•Voice Assisted devices (for voice recognition)</p>
      <p>•Motion sensors (lights turn on when user enters through main door or in a specific room)    </p>
    <p>•Alarm devices (Lights turn on/off based on the time set by user)</p> 
    <p>•Microcontroller, light intensity sensor</p>

    <h3>Activity 2</h3>

    <h4>What state for each light is needed?</h4>
    <p>The state of the light lies between 0 and 1, that is, it can be greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 1.
        Hence indicating, the light can be dimmed, switched on, switched off.
        (USE OF PWM and Duty Cycles)</p>

    <h4>What state is needed?</h4>
    <p>•Auto cut mode </p>
    <p>•Energy saving mode</p>
    <p>•Hot and cold mode ( adjusts the temperature based on the current room temperature maintaining a comfortable environment)</p>
    <p>•External air mode</p>
    <p>•Automatic cooling capacity (ton) adjustment (adjusts ACs power based on the number people present in the room)</p>
    <p>•Single user mode (Memory function)</p>
    <p>•Air quality control</p>
    <p>•Silent mode</p>
    <p>•Geofencing</p>

    <h4>What else would be useful information? </h4> 
    <p>•Room temperature</p>
    <p>Humidity</p> 
    <p>•Number of users</p>
    <p>•Insulation</p>
    <p>•Room size</p> 
    <p>•Power consumption</p>

    <p>•AC fault prediction/ maintenance reports</p>
    


    <h3>Activity 3</h3>
    <h4>How can smart-lighting and smart air-conditioning interact?</h4>
    <div class="white">
    <p>•Number of users present in the proximity (Cooling capacity and output)</p>
    <p>•Bluetooth and WiFi use (IP address would be same across the building)    </p>
    <p>•Light color change based on the cooling and vice versa</p>
    <p>•Remote monitoring (using an interface)</p>
    <p>•motion sensing </p>    
    </div>
    <h4>What other devices could be used?</h4>
    <p>•Air quality monitoring    </p>
    <p>•Smart Evacuation system</p>
     <p>•Motion sensors</p>
